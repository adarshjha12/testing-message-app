this is a full stack social media application where you can engage with your friends and family via posts, messages, video calls.
i have made this app very secure with google Oauth authentication provided by passport.js. your messages will be encrypted, so only sender and reciever can read that message. so you don't have to worry about leaking those conversations. you can also send files like image, video, pdf etc.

this application is based on nextjs, nodejs, and mongodb. it also uses socket.io, webrtc and many more libraries.
